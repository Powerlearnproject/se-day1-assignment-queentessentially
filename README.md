Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Question 1: Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Answer: To put it simply, software engineering is the application of engineering principles (discipline, so to speak) to software development (including its design, testing, and maintenance). In this lies its importance to the technology industry. For example, thanks to the disciplined approach to software development, more secure software systems that are resistant to attacks and protect sensitive data are built. Not just that, but well-engineered software is far easier to maintain, update, and modify over time.

Question 2: Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

Answer: The first would be what is known as "The Software Crisis" which occurred in the 1960s through to the 1980s. In this time period, software systems were becoming larger and more complex, and as a result, it became increasingly difficult to manage their development and ensure their quality. This led to late deliveries, overbudget projects, and unreliable software, ultimately causing property damage and even loss of lives. This crisis led to the development of structured programming, top-down design, and other methodologies to address the challenges of large-scale software development. Shortly after this, in the 1990s, came the rise of object-oriented programming which introduced the idea of modelling real-world objects and their interactions as software components. OOP provided a more reusable approach to software development, leading to the creation of more maintainable and scalable systems. Languages like C++, Java, and Python became widely popular due to their OOP capabilities. Then came the 2000s which brought about the advent of agile software development, an umbrella term for software utilising agile methodologies, which emphasise iterative development, customer collaboration, and continuous improvement. They focus on delivering working software incrementally and adapting to changing requirements.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
